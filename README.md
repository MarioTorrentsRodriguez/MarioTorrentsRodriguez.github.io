# Bubble Bobble Tribute

Bubble Bobble is a classic arcade game where you control two dragons, Bub and Bob, who trap enemies in bubbles to clear each level. In this tribute, we have recreated the first four levels of the game.

Bubble Bobble features an addictive gameplay where you play through 100 leves, and upon finishing the final level (including an epic boss battle), you save your family.

In our tribute, we have reproduced the first four levels of Bubble Bobble, capturing the essence and challenge of the original.
